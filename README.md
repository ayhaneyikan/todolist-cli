# Todo List CLI

This is a little personal project addressing my desire for a simply command line todo list.
It is quite possible that such a program already exists with more capability, however, I thought this would be a fun little project to explore nonetheless.

Primarily the focus of this project is to explore two things:
1. the Rust programming language
2. creating a deploying my own executable program
